- Extensive use of generics for flexible and reusable data structures.
- Implementation of the `Pair` and `Triple` classes to store different types of data together.

### Data Processing
- Extraction and processing of data from a list of boxers, including names, wins, and losses.
- Calculation of win percentages using a mathematical formula.
- Effective data manipulation and transformation.

### Comparison and Analysis
- Comparison of win percentages to identify the boxer with the highest win percentage.
- Logical thinking and decision-making through conditional statements.

### Code Organization
- Well-organized project structure with multiple classes.
- Adherence to best practices for code structure and readability.

### Readability and Output
- Clear and readable output with boxer names and win percentages.
- Proper formatting and user-friendly display of results.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Generics and parameterized types.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Data extraction and manipulation.
- Mathematical calculations.
- Conditional statements and decision-making.
- Code organization and best practices.
- Output formatting and user-friendly presentation.

This project serves as an excellent example of advanced Java programming skills, showcasing proficiency in generics, data processing, logical comparisons, code organization, and output presentation.
